# Session 2: Data Thinking – The Science of Decision-Making

## Introduction

Welcome back! In today’s session, we’ll be discussing something equally important: **data thinking**. It’s the science behind how we process data and how we can design better strategies using data. We’re going to explore the role of storytelling in data, how we make decisions, and the crucial difference between correlation and causation. 

## How Humans Process Data and Why Storytelling Matters

Humans are natural storytellers. We’ve been telling stories for centuries, and it’s how we make sense of the world around us. When it comes to data, storytelling is just as important. It helps people understand the meaning behind numbers and gives context to raw data.

Data by itself can be overwhelming. Numbers and figures, especially in large quantities, can seem abstract and disconnected. But when we weave those numbers into a narrative, we allow people to engage with the information in a meaningful way.

### Why does storytelling matter in data?
- **It simplifies complex data**: A well-told story highlights the key points and makes the data more relatable.
- **It helps with decision-making**: A story helps decision-makers see the bigger picture and understand the implications of data.
- **It creates emotional engagement**: Data can sometimes feel cold and distant, but a good story brings it to life and connects with the audience emotionally.

In the book *Storytelling with Data* by Knaflic, the author talks about how to effectively communicate data through visualizations and narratives. It’s not just about showing the data but about making sure the audience **feels** the data.

### Key Takeaways:
- Storytelling is a **tool for clarity**. It turns complex data into something understandable and actionable.
- **Engagement** is crucial. By presenting data as part of a story, we create emotional connections that help drive decisions.

## The Difference Between Correlation and Causation

Now, let’s talk about a very important concept when dealing with data: **correlation vs causation**. These two are often confused, but understanding the difference is crucial for accurate decision-making.

- **Correlation** means that two variables are related, but it doesn't mean one causes the other. For example, ice cream sales and drowning incidents may both increase in the summer, but eating ice cream doesn't cause drowning. It’s just a seasonal trend.
  
- **Causation**, on the other hand, implies that one event directly influences the other. For instance, if you increase your marketing budget and see a rise in sales, it’s likely that the budget increase caused the sales boost.

When we use data to make decisions, it's important to distinguish between these two. Relying on **correlation** without understanding causation can lead to misguided decisions.

### Why does this matter?
- **Misinterpreting correlation as causation** can lead to poor decisions and wasted resources.
- A thorough analysis of data is required to ensure that we are not just identifying patterns, but also understanding the **underlying causes**.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Correlation** is a relationship, but **causation** is cause and effect.
- Always ask: “What is driving this relationship?” before acting on data.

## Designing Data-Driven Strategies

Now that we’ve covered the importance of storytelling and understanding the difference between correlation and causation, let’s talk about how to design data-driven strategies.

The key to a successful data-driven strategy is understanding the business problem and then using data to drive solutions. Here’s how you can go about it:

1. **Start with the problem**: Before diving into the data, clearly define the problem you're trying to solve. This ensures that you focus on the right data and the right analysis.
  
2. **Identify the data you need**: Once the problem is defined, determine what data is necessary to answer the key questions. This is where understanding correlation vs causation comes in—use data that is relevant and has strong causal links to your goals.
  
3. **Analyze and create a narrative**: After gathering data, analyze it and start weaving a story around it. What insights are you uncovering? How does it all fit together? Tell the story in a way that is easy to follow and supports the decision you need to make.
  
4. **Test, iterate, and refine**: Finally, a data-driven strategy isn't static. As new data comes in, refine your strategy. Iterate based on feedback and continuously improve.

### Key Takeaways:
- A **data-driven strategy** starts with the problem, not the data.
- It’s important to focus on **relevant data** and use **causal relationships** to drive decisions.
- The strategy should be a **living document**, evolving as new insights emerge.

## Conclusion

In today’s world, decision-making is increasingly being shaped by data. But to make the right decisions, we need to understand how we process data, how to tell a compelling story with it, and how to make sure we're not jumping to conclusions based on false correlations.

By using storytelling to present data, understanding the distinction between correlation and causation, and designing data-driven strategies, we can make better decisions that drive growth and success.
